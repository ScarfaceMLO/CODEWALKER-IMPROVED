# CodeWalker Improved

**CodeWalker Improved** is a modified version of the original CodeWalker project developed by Dexyfex.

This fork was created to meet my personal needs and improve certain aspects of the workflow. The goal is to add features that make editing easier and the overall experience more comfortable.

The project is still at an early stage of development. It will evolve progressively and some bugs may be present.

All credits go to Dexyfex for the original work.
